	<p><b>Charlotte Tilbury</b> is a brand that has become very well established within the beauty industry due to Charlottes knowledge of makeup having worked within the industry for over 20 years. I am a huge fan of Charlottes makeup and skincare and not just because of the beautiful rose gold packaging. I’ve been lucky enough to try out a fair amount of her cosmetic range and i’m yet to be disappointed by anything as everything is made with such precision and quality. When you see Charlotte talk about her products, she is so passionate and you know she has poured everything into making them the best they can be. I am a huge fan of her matte lipsticks (Glastonberry is probably my most worn lipstick EVER), her eyeshadows and her mascara. Despite the fact i’ve tried a lot of her makeup, I still seem to find myself scouring the website in search of more cosmetic staples *slaps hand & apologises to debit card*. I decided to go on the website to order the “Magic Cream” moisturiser which i’ve used two travel sized pots of since Christmas (absolutely love this – see below), and 30 minutes later, other things seemed to have crept into my basket too.<br><br> The Magic Cream came as a sample in the Charlotte Tilbury advent calendar and gift boxes last year and I hadn’t heard too much about it from fellow bloggers so there was never any rushed desire to use it up. I keep a makeup bag full of travel sized products in my bathroom ranging from shampoos, hair masks, face masks and lotions and potions as they’re always good when you go away on holiday or for mini weekend breaks. I took the Magic Cream moisturiser in a quick last minute dashed packing frenzy and once i’d used it, my makeup had never looked so good. My face is a bit of a complex thing,in some places it’s oily with blemishes and in other places it’s dry and very dehydrated and it’s been quite the journey discovering the best products to use on my skin. The cream is quite thick, in fact it’s probably the thickest moisturiser i’ve ever used and I’m sure that might scare a few people away initially, but it worked wonders for me, and two sample pots down I now have the full size sitting with pride of place on my vanity unit. Charlotte states that she has been mixing this cream for over 20 years to perfect it for her clients. Going by the description on the website, it includes ingredients like bionymph peptide complex which is a unique, patented anti-age ingredient that multi-tasks in the skin, fighting the ageing process, sodium hyaluronate which forms a film of hyaluronic acid over the skin to seal in moisture, whilst extracts of wild pansy promote the renewal of hyaluronic acid in the skin surface to retain moisture leaving your skin feeling dewy and plump! There’s also a mix of rose hip oil, camellia oil and anti-oxidant vitamin e to transform a grey complexion into hydrated, mirror-shine skin, nourishing vitamin a to help improve skin firmness and smoothness and energetic vitamin c to promote collagen activity for more youthful skin. We aren’t done yet, it also includes damask rose water and organic aloe vera to benefit skin regeneration, fighting the signs of ageing (no harm in starting that now…I am 26 after all). There are extracts of frangipani to form a soothing, purifying and hydrating comfort-blanket on the skin and It’s also worth noting that it contains no parabens.<br><br>I use this cream when I feel that my skin could really benefit from an injection of moisture and a little va va voom. I don’t use this every day as it can be a little thick and i’m not entirely sure anyone with more oily or acne prone skin would get on particularly well with it. I go through phases when my skin is dry and then oily, so for my particularly dry days, I’ll wear this. I don’t use too much, but I really notice the difference it gives to my skin and it is like a face mask in a jar (one that you don’t have to sit and wait to dry before washing off). My makeup blends well, it tends to last longer and I generally just look a lot healthier in the skin department. When my second sample jar ran out and my skin was having a dull dry day, I frantically went on a search for another sample pot and when I didn’t have one, I was massively disappointed. At that moment I knew I would have to fork out for the larger jar!<br><br> As the only other things i’ve truly trialled and tested in this haul, I thought it would be worth mentioning the Lipsticks! Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks are one of my favourite high end formulas. Setting you back £23 a pop, you would expect them to be nothing but amazing. Besides the beautiful and decadent packaging; the colours, the formulation and the wear of the lipsticks is what makes them worth every penny. Which is why, along with many other things i’m excited to get stuck into and smear all over my face, there are now two more additions to my overgrown lipstick jungle in my makeup drawer. </p>
